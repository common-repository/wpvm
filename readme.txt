WPVM (WordPress Varnish Modified) purges pages from Varnish caching servers. [DEPRECATED]


== Description ==

*WPVM* (WordPress Varnish Modified) helps you purge your cached content from Varnish caches.

WPVM version 2 is an almost complete rewrite of [WP-Varnish](https://github.com/pkhamre/wp-varnish) plugin v0.8.

**NOTICE:** THIS PLUGIN HAS BEEN **DEPRECATED**. IT IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED. IT IS NO LONGER TESTED WITH NEW WORDPRESS RELEASES. USING IT IN PRODUCTION IS NOT RECOMMENDED.

IT IS STRONGLY SUGGESTED TO MIGRATE TO OTHER MORE MODERN AND BETTER MAINTAINED PLUGINS.

IF YOU ARE STARTING A NEW BLOG, IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO SEARCH FOR OTHER PLUGINS IN ORDER TO AVOID THE INEVITABLE FUTURE MIGRATION.

REGARDING EXISTING USERS, THE CACHE INVALIDATION FUNCTIONALITY OF THIS PLUGIN SHOULD BE CONSIDERED INCOMPLETE. PLEASE SWITCH TO A MORE COMPLETE PLUGIN.

<blockquote>

<strong>Important Notice</strong>

<br /><br />

This project should be considered <strong>experimental</strong>. The current implementation possibly has some design flaws and inefficiencies and a third major refactoring of the code will possibly be needed. Unfortunately, my free time right now is very limited for something like that, so I have postponed any further development for the future and I have currently switched to other Varnish cache purging solutions.

<br /><br />

Although the plugin works, <strong>I do not recommend using it in a production environment</strong>. Please check the plugin repository for more modern and better maintained plugins that suit your needs. Please note that, if you continue using this plugin in production, you are on your own.

<br /><br />
